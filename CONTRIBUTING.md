# Contributing

 This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

 We use the GitHub issue tracker to discuss new features and bugs.

 In addition to the issue tracker, the PLCnext Technology [Forum](https://www.plcnext-community.net/forum/) is the best way to get into contact with the project's maintainers.

 To contribute code or documentation for available projects, please use an issue with an *easy-pick* label.
 Our [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) will review and implement the changes.

 If you are interested in contributing to the PLCnext Technology platform, please contact CommunityExamples@phoenixcontact.com.
 After reviewing, we will decide together, if your project will be forked from our organisation or if you get a member and transfer the repository to the organisation.
