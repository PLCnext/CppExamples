## Introduction

The PLCnext Runtime provides an RSC service, called `IDataAccessService`, that a client can use to read and write Global Data Space (GDS) variables. From the API documentation for `IDataAccessService`:

> The direct access functionality is a way for reading and writing values from and to variables. This is the fastest way, with a minimum of influence to the real time process, but it is not guaranteed that the data will be read/write in the same task cycle. For task consistent reading the subscription service `Arp.Plc.Gds.Services.ISubscriptionService` has to be used.

## Quick-start example

This example demonstrates features of the Data Access RSC service.

It is assumed that the user has some experience [building C++ Components and Programs for PLCnext Control](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cpp/Cpp_programming/Cpp_programs_in_PLCnext.htm).

Prerequisites:

- PLCnext Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, version 2021.0. This is included in the "PLCnext Technology C++ tool chain", available on the Phoenix Contact website.

- A Software Development Kit (SDK) for the AXC F 2152 PLCnext Control, version 2021.0.0 or later. This is also included in the "PLCnext Technology C++ tool chain".

- (optional) Eclipse IDE, with the PLCnext Technology feature installed.

- (optional) Visual Studio, with the PLCnext Technology add-in installed.

- PLCnext Engineer version 2021.0.1 or later.

Procedure:

- Clone this repository, e.g.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PLCnext/CppExamples.git
   ```

- Create the GDS variables that will be accessed:
  - Create a new PLCnext Engineer project for your target PLC.
  - Create one cyclic task.
  - Add the User Library "DataAccess.pcwlx", which is included in the `Examples/DataAccessExample` directory of this repository. This library contains one Program, called "DataAccess".
  - Create one instance of the "DataAccess" program in the cyclic task.
  - Name the program instance `DataAccessInstance`.
  - Write and start the project on the PLC.

- Create a new **ACF project** using either the PLCnext CLI tool, or Eclipse, or Visual Studio, with the following settings:
  - Project name: `DataAccess`
  - Component name: `DataAccessComponent`
  - Project namespace: `DataAccess`

- Copy the contents of the `Examples/DataAccessExample/src` directory in this repository, to the `src` directory of the ACF project. Replace the existing source files with the same name.

- Build the ACF project.

- Deploy the ACF project to the PLC.

- Restart the PLCnext Runtime.

- Check the contents of the file `/opt/plcnext/logs/Output.log`. It should contain messages showing the values of some OUT port variables from the `DataAccessInstance` program instance.

- In the PLCnext Engineer project, in Debug mode, add the IN port variables from `DataAccessInstance` to the Watch window. The values of some of these variables are being written by the C++ component using the Data Access RSC service.
