The CLI will automatically set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to find CMake packages to
this directory or a sub-directory of this directory. To decide which directory
to use for the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH the CLI looks for a directory with the name
<target_name>_<target_version>.

To choose such a directory the target_name must match the current build target
name and the version must be lower or equal to the current build target
version. If such a directory is found the CLI looks whether the directory
contains the current build type (Release, Debug, ...). If no such directory is
found it looks for a directory named "Release".

If the CLI finds the build type directory or the "Release" directory it uses
this directory as CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. If not it uses as fallback the found
target specific directory. If that is not found it uses the external directory.
If the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is already set by a command line option it will not
override the set value.

Please make sure that if the libraries which are used by this project use other
libraries themself, that the library must have the RPATH set to $ORIGIN.
