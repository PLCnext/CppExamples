The [CppExamples](https://github.com/PLCnext/CppExamples) repository is a collection of various sample code for PLCnext Technology controllers. 
It is assumed that the reader has basic know-how of C++ programming and has read the key parts of the [PLCnext Info Center](https://www.plcnext.help/).  
Each example explains one or more topics on how to use C++11 with PLCnext Technology. Explanations are given in the *README.md* document and via comments in the example code. 
Each example holds separate user components which can be instantiated on a *PLCnext Control*. 

This project aims to supply, over time, examples and best practices of PLCnext Technology functions regarding C++11.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: All the examples on this `master` branch of this repository have been updated to work with firmware versions 2025.0 and later. These examples may not compatible with firmware versions earier than 2025.0. Examples for earlier firmware versions are located on the `Pre-2025.0` branch.**

## Getting started

- [C++ programs in PLCnext Technology](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cplusplus/Cpp-programming.htm)
- [Required Installations for C++ programming](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cplusplus/Cpp_Required_installations.htm)
- [Working with Eclipse](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cplusplus/Working_with_Eclipse.htm)

## Compiling an example

There are different ways to build your code:

### Compile the code with the PLCnext CLI 

1. Install Eclipse IDE, CLI, SDK and Eclipse Add-in (how-to guide: see links in the "Getting started" section above)
1. Clone this repository
1. Navigate to the project you want to test, e.g. `cd Examples/ProgramComponentInteraction` 
1. Execute `plcncli new project -c DummyC -p DummyP && ls -la src && rm src/Dummy*` or `plcncli new acfproject -c DummyC && ls -la src && rm src/Dummy*` for acf projects
1. Execute `plcncli set target --add --name AXCF2152 --version 2024.7` to specify details of the build target
1. Execute `plcncli generate all` to generate intermediate code and Config files
1. Execute `plcncli build` to build the code.
1. Execute `plcncli deploy` to generate a *.pcwlx* file that can be included in PLCnext Engineer 

### Compile using the Eclipse Add-in

1. Create a new empty project named like the example you want to test
1. Remove the source files located at `ProjectName/src`
1. Move the source files from the example you want to use into your workspace at `ProjectName/src`
1. Build the project

### Compile using [build.sh](tools/build.sh) script

1. Clone this Repository
1. Modify the [build.sh](tools/build.sh) script to fit your needs
    1. select hardware
    1. select project
    1. rename folder to fit namespace name (e.g. mv Examples/OpcUaMethodExample Examples/OpcPlcManager)
    1. switch between `acfproject` and `project` command if necessary
1. Make sure it is executable for example with ```chmod +x tools/build.sh```
1. Execute the script ```./tools/build.sh``` or  ```sh tools/build.sh ```
