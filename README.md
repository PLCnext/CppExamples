The [CppExamples](https://github.com/PLCnext/CppExamples) repository is a collection of various sample code for PLCnext Technology controllers. 
It is assumed that the reader has basic know-how of C++ programming and has read the key parts of the [PLCnext Info Center](https://www.plcnext.help/).  
Each example explains one or more topics on how to use C++11 with PLCnext Technology. Explanations are given in the *README.md* document and via comments in the example code. 
Each example holds separate user components which can be instantiated on a *PLCnext Control*. 

This project aims to supply, over time, examples and best practices of PLCnext Technology functions regarding C++11.

## Table of Contents

|\#| Topic | Content | SourceCode
| ----- | ------ | ------ |------
|[01](Examples/ProgramComponentInteraction/)| [Program Component Interaction](Examples/ProgramComponentInteraction/README.md)| This example shows two *PLCnext programs* interacting with a *PLCnext component* by getting or setting variables through reference.| [SourceCode](Examples/ProgramComponentInteraction/src/)
|[02](Examples/CppDataTypeTest/)| [Data Type Exchange Example](Examples/CppDataTypeTest/README.md)| This example shows how to transfer data from a C++ project to the GDS. Variables published to the GDS can be accessed by other programs (IEC/C++/Simulink/C#) or the IOs| [SourceCode](Examples/CppDataTypeTest/src/)
|[03](Examples/IncludeOpenSourceLibrary/)| [Include an Open Source Library](Examples/IncludeOpenSourceLibrary/README.md)| This describes how to use a third-party open-source library in a C++ project that is built for PLCnext Control using Eclipse|
|[04](Examples/ThreadExample/)| [Thread Example](Examples/ThreadExample/README.md)| This describes how to implement Threads in a component of C++ project.| [SourceCode](Examples/ThreadExample/src/)
|[05](Examples/NotificationExample/)| [Notification Example](Examples/NotificationExample/README.MD)| This describes how to use the Notification Manager.| [SourceCode](Examples/NotificationExample/src/)
|[06](Examples/E_Learning_InternalFunctionExtensions/)| [E-Learning: InternalFunctionExtensions](Examples/E_Learning_InternalFunctionExtensions/README.MD)| This describes how to use the Internal Function Extensions.| [SourceCode](Examples/E_Learning_InternalFunctionExtensions/src/)

## Getting started

- [C++ programs in PLCnext Technology](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cpp/Cpp_programming/Cpp_programs_in_PLCnext.htm)
- [Required Installations for C++ programming](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cpp/Cpp_programming/Required_Installations.htm)
- [Creating a new C++ project in Eclipse](https://www.plcnext.help/te/Programming/Cpp/Cpp_programming/Creating_a_Cpp_project_in_Eclipse.htm)

## Compiling an example

There are different ways how to build your code:

### Compile the code with the PLCnext CLI 

1. Install Eclipse IDE, CLI, SDK and Eclipse Add-in (how-to guide: see links in the "Getting started" section above)
1. Clone this repository
1. Navigate to the project you want to test, e.g. `cd Examples/ProgramComponentInteraction` 
1. Execute `plcncli new project -c DummyC -p DummyP && ls -la src && rm src/Dummy*`
1. Execute `plcncli set target --add --name AXCF2152 --version 2020.6` to specify details of the build target
1. Execute `plcncli generate all` to generate intermediate code and Config files
1. Execute `plcncli build` to build the code.
1. Execute `plcncli deploy` to generate a *.pcwlx* file that can be included in PLCnext Engineer 

### Compile using the Eclipse Add-in

1. Create a new empty project named like the example you want to test
1. Remove the source files located at `ProjectName/src`
1. Move the source files from the example you want to use into your workspace at `ProjectName/src`
1. Build the project

### Compile using [build-local.sh](tools/build-local.sh) script

1. Clone this Repository
1. Modify the [build-local.sh](tools/build-local.sh) script to fit your needs
    1. select Hardware
    1. select Project
1. Make sure it is executable for example with ```chmod +x tools/build-local.sh```
1. Execute the script ```./tools/build-local.sh``` or  ```sh tools/build-local.sh ```
